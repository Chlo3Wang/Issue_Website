          <p>Since the eaerly age of Hollywood cinema, Asian women have been reduced to
            to two highly sexualized tropes. The Lotus Flower/China Doll trope reinforces
            the idea of Asian women as dainty and subservient. Traditionally, if Asian women
            in media are not Lotus Flowers, then they are Dragon Ladies. This trope paints
            Asian women as deceitful and dangerous.</p>

          <p>“I think there is a lot of hope,” Dr. Ana-Christina Ramón, Director of Research and Civic Engagement for UCLA’s Division of Social Sciences, told Nerdist. “For TV, it can be as short as a six-month [period] or nine-month period. But, for film, it takes at least one [to three] years down the road. So I feel like there is a lot of potential and there will be a lot more representation. And, in terms of [seeing] that these are projects that are being financed by Asian Americans, [but] also directed or produced by [Asian Americans].”</p>

            <p>For Asian women, the media has begun to see a change. Television series and films are depicting their characters with nuance. In just the past two years, titles like The Half of It, The Farewell, Always Be My Maybe, Never Have I Ever, PEN15, Nora from Queens, To All the Boys trilogy, and Killing Eve provided fresh narratives for Asian women, extending beyond racial backgrounds.</p>
