        <p>Since the early age of Hollywood cinema, Asian women have been reduced to two highly sexualized tropes. The Lotus Flower/China Doll trope reinforces the idea of Asian women as dainty and subservient. One film with an especially long-lasting effect is 1987’s critically acclaimed Vietnam War film Full Metal Jacket. In the film, a Vietnamese sex worker tells American soldiers, “Me so horny. Me love you long time.” This piece of dialogue has been sampled into 2 Live Crew’s song “Me So Horny” and Sir-Mix-a-Lot’s 1992 hit “Baby Got Back,” and has been referenced in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, South Park, and Family Guy, among others.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, if Asian women in media are not Lotus Flowers, then they are Dragon Ladies. This trope paints Asian women as deceitful and dangerous. Historically, the trope has been associated with actress Anna May Wong, who played the villainous temptress in 1924’s The Thief of Baghdad and 1931’s Daughter of the Dragon. Decades after Wong’s portrayals, Hollywood still did not learn from their mistakes.<P>
      <p>Take the early career of Lucy Liu. In the 1990s to the early 2000s, she was resigned to cold, sexually manipulative characters in the likes of Ally McBeal and Quentin Tarantino’s Kill Bill. (Although Liu has defended the latter.) Thankfully, as her career progressed, Liu found roles in Charlie’s Angels, Elementary, and Why Women Kill—successful films and shows where her ethnicity did not play a part.</p>
